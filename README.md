# Product Overview
Nerve offers a Blockchain solution that connects content creators with their viewers. Through our app, users can propose financially incentivized tasks to each other and create their own betting services.

# The NERVE application is currently in its test phase and runs on the Ropsten Ethereum Testnet!

# How to install
Get the latest app version from https://github.com/NERVEGLOBAL/NERVE_app/releases and unpack the .zip or execute the setup to save the NERVE desktop application on your PC. 

# Getting started
After launching the application for the first time, you will be required to choose a 8 digit PIN and generate a new Ethereum wallet or import an existing one per Mnemonic words. The wallet generation process will give you 12 Mnemonic words that are needed to access your Ethereum wallet and should be written down. If the wallet file is deleted and the words are lost, the funds on the wallet can not be restored! On each login after creating or importing a wallet, you are only required to type in your chosen PIN to login.

# How to get Ethereum
After logging into your wallet, navigate to the wallet history display by clicking on the two arrows in the Navigation Bar at the bottom. Click on the "Receive" button to get your Ethereum wallet address.

To get Ropsten Testnet Ethereum:
Go to https://faucet.ropsten.be/ or to a Ropsten faucet of your choice and copy your wallet address into the textfield. Click the button to get Ropsten Eth until the message appears that you were successful.

# Note: Every action in the NERVE app requires Ethereum to succeed.

# Change your Username
To change your username navigate to your Dashboard and click the “Edit Profile”-Button. The stream-link box is Optional.
Note that changing your username also requires Ethereum. Without a username, you will not be able to create bets or tasks.

# Creating a Task
To create a task for another user you can navigate to the search window and search for a specific user by name or find one through a global task or bet in the Global feed. After navigating to the users Dashboard click on the “Create Task”-Button. You will be required to choose a minimum entry fee, a duration and a description for your task. 

# Creating a Bet
To create a bet for other users, you need to navigate to your own Dashboard and click the “Create Bet”-Button. You are required to choose a description and optional 2 outcomes if it is not a YES/NO bet. You also need to set the percentage of the share you will receive through this bet.

# Promoting your Bet or Task to the Global feed
Every user can see the global feed.
To promote a task that was given to you or a bet you created, click the star symbol in the upper left corner of the bet or task. You will receive a list of the current prices of the top spots and can then decide how much you want to pay in Ethereum to promote your bet / task to the global feed.
